// Learning Objectives:
// 1) Build upon the skills you've already worked on
// - DOM Manipulationm, - Looping, - Utilising Data Structures
// Challenge:
// We have a pub quiz form that was left incomplete
// Using the questions, answers and multiple choice options provided,
// dynamically fill out the quiz and return an answer

// Expected Outcome:
// 1) Initially there is an example question structure
// 2) Your script should only fill the pub quiz sheet with relevant questions
// from the question data you've been providied.
// You can choose 5 questions from this data to use, or check bonus objective
// 3) The submit button should return all selected answers, compare them with
// the correct answer and display your result in the result div element.
// example: 5/5 correct!
// **bonus:**
// 1) Instead of choosing some questions to use, code it to pick 5 random
// questions when the quiz is generated.

import { questions } from "./questions.js";
